    <h1 class="textTitle">About Me</h1>
    
    <p class="textContent">I'm a brazilian Frontend Developer passionate about technology, based in Stockholm/Sweden.<br> 
       
        <br>Technology is a new thing for me. I used to work as a Nutritionist and I have a M.Sc. in Nutrition and Health. 
        While doing my master's, I discovered the world of coding and decided that this was the right path for me. 
        Currently, I'm a full-time student at <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a>. Most of my work is using HTML, CSS and javaScript.<br> 

        <br>Another big passion of mine is to travel and be able to discover different cultures. I have visit around 30 contries and hope to continue visiting more and more.<br>
    
        <br>You can ask me about changing careers, traveling, about Brazil and of course, coding and eating healthy.<br>
